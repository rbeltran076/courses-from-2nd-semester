    "    * A. $F\\propto 1/r^2$.\n",
    "3. The dielectric strength of air is $3 MV/m$, what should be the minimum separation between the plates of a capacitor to avoid dielectric breakdown given a voltage of $4kV$?\n",
    "    * minimum separation translates into maximum electric field between the plates, which can be written in terms of voltage as $d_{min}=\\Delta V/E_{max}=3\\times 10^3(V)/4\\times 10^6(V/m)=0.75mm$.\n",
    "4. A charge $Q_1$ is located on the positive $x$ axis, and another charge $Q_2$ is located on the same axis but further away from the origin $O$. Knowing that the total electric charge is zero in $O$, what can we state about the signs of the charges? and what about their magnitudes?\n",
    "    * For the net electric field to be zero at the origin, signs of charges must be opposite. Additionally, the smallest charge should be closer to the origin so $|Q_2|>|Q_1|$.\n",

    "6. For parallel-plate capacitor with $d=1mm$, how much surface do we need to store $1F$?\n",
    "    * $A=Cd/\\epsilon_0=1F\\times 10^{-3}m/8.85\\times10^{-12}(F/m)=10km^2$. A square of side $10km$.\n",

    "A parallel-plate capacitor is made from two plates $12 cm$ on each side and $4.50 mm$ apart. Half of the space between these plates contains only air, but the other half is filled with Plexiglas of relative permittivity  3.40 as shown below. An 18.0-V battery is connected across the plates. \n",

    "Calculate how much the capacitance varies when we introduce a layer of methacrylate $d/2$ thick, as illustrated below. In other words, calculate the ratio $\\frac{C_{\\text {final}}}{C_{\\text {initial}}}$. (Hint: for this calculation you will probably want to determine the voltage $V$ between the plates. Assume that the electric field between the plates is like the one created by an infinite parallel-plate capacitor, so you can use the expression for the electric field given in the class notes for two oppositely charged infinite sheets, the only difference is that  you have to take into account that there are two regions with different permittivity)\n",
