    "These are functions. A lot of things in math, science and CS are \"modeled\" as functions, a function is a mathematical tool that allows me to enter something and get something else in return, just like a transformation of information. Input turn into output from functions.\n",

    "A probability distribution is a function that takes as input an outcome of an experiment, this is, an event, a situation. And outputs the probability of that particular outcome.\n",
    "For example, if we use the probability distribution function of a coin toss, and input the \"Heads\" outcome, it will output \"0.5\" as there is 50% chance of getting \"Heads\" as the outcome.\n",
